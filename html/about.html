            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name's Samuel. I am a Software development student currently enrolled at St Clair colleges Mobile
                Application Development programme. Before enrolling in this programme, I attended Catholic central high
                school, where I explored my interest in science and technology by taking part in the schools coding club
                programme and participating in the school's robotics team.
            </p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is to make technology intuitive and more appealing by bridging the gap between technology and
                design where possible, offering the best of both worlds while capturing a brand's personality by
                developing comprehensive and minimalistic identities.
            </p>
            <h2>Let's make something special.</h2>
